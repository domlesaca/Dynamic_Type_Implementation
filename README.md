# Dynamic_Type_Implementation
Implementation of Dynamic Typing semantics in C# and C++.  This project was completed as a part of COMP 241:  Programming Language Semantics.

This contains two implementations of Abadi et al.'s semantic definition for Dynamic Typing in a Statically Typed Language.  The C++ implementation is located in "Dynamic Typing in C++".  The code for the C# implementation is located in "Dynamic_Type_Emulation" with the automated tests being located in "Dynamic_Type_Tests".  All C# code was built in Visual Studio using .Net Core 3.0.  The tests were built using the MSTest framework.
